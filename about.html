<p><b>Subedar Ajay Singh Rautela hailed from Rampur village of in Tehri district of Uttrakhand. Son of late Shri Awwal Singh Rautela, he had a younger brother Deepak as his sibling. He studied from Rajkiya Inter college Jajal and joined the army following into the footsteps of his father, who too served in the army. He was recruited into 17 Garhwal Rifles battalion of the Garhwal Rifles Regiment, an infantry Regiment known for its brave soldiers with a rich history of various battle honours.



After serving for few years, Sub Ajay Singh got married to Ms Sunita and the couple had three sons Arun, Sumit and Amit. By 2021, he had put in over two decades of service and had been promoted to the rank of Subedar. By that time, he had developed into a devoted solder and dependable Junior Commissioned Officer. Later he was deputed to serve with 48 RR battalion, deployed in J&K for counter-insurgency operations. 




During Oct 2021, Sub Ajay Singh‘s unit 48 RR was deployed in Poonch district of J&K. The unit troops were engaged in operations against the terrorists on a regular basis as the unit's area of responsibility (AOR) was active with militancy. The LOC located near to its AOR, remained highly active and volatile with ceasefire violations occurring very often and without any warning. The area was also prone to infiltration, which necessitated regular armed patrols to check any infiltration from across the border. Following inputs from the intelligence sources about the presence of some terrorists, the security forces including the troops of 48 RR launched a search operation in Nar Khas forest area in Mendhar sector of Poonch dist on 15 Oct 2021. Sub Ajay Singh was part of the team that launched the search and destroy operation. 



Sub Ajay Singh and his comrades reached the suspected area and launched the cordon and search operation. The troops soon made contact with the terrorists, who fired at the troops on being challenged. A fierce gun battle followed thereafter with heavy exchange of fire. As the cordon around the terrorists was tightened, they started firing indiscriminately in a desperate attempt. During the heavy cross firing Sub Ajay Singh and Naik Harendra Singh received gun shots and got seriously injured. They later succumbed to their injuries and were martyred, but their bodies could be recovered only on 16 Oct 2021. Sub Ajay Singh was a gritty and valiant JCO, who laid down his life in the line of his duty.

<p><b>
Days after the government announced the creation of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) post, retiring Army chief, General Bipin Rawat, was appointed the first tri-service chief with effect from December 31, 2019. General Rawat was the first sitting Chief of Army Staff to be appointed to the top post. The government had initially amended the Army rules to extend the age of superannuation from 62 years to 65 years, paving the way for the appointment. The CDS is a one-point advisor to the government on matters related to the military and will function with the main aim of integrating the three services — Army, Navy and the Air Force. CDS would also be the permanent Chief of Staff Committee (COSC).
 
General Bipin Rawat had taken over the reins of the Indian Army from General Dalbir Singh Suhag on December 17, 2016, as the 27th Chief of Army Staff (COAS).
 
On December 8, 2021, the 63-year-old's life was cut short after a tragic chopper crash in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu in which Rawat, his wife and 11 others on board the ill-fated helicopter.
 
The copter carrying General Rawat and his entourage crashed in apparently foggy conditions, the IAF and other officials said. He is survived by two daughters.


Born in Pauri, Uttarakhand on March 16, 1958, his family had been serving in the Indian Army for multiple generations. His father Laxman Singh Rawat was from Sainj village of the Pauri Garhwal district and rose to the rank of Lt General.
 
An alumnus of the National Defence Academy (NDA) and the Indian Military Academy (IMA), Rawat was commissioned into the Indian Army in December 1978 in the same unit as his father, the fifth battalion of 11 Gorkha Rifles. The first CDS is a veteran of counterinsurgency warfare and has served in some of the most difficult terrains of India, including the northern and eastern commands.
 
During his 43-years in service, Rawat served as a Brigade Commander, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-C) Southern Command, General Staff Officer Grade 2 at the Military Operations Directorate, Colonel Military Secretary and Deputy Military Secretary in the Military Secretary’s Branch and Senior Instructor in the Junior Command Wing. He was also a part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force and has commanded a multinational brigade in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
 
Rawat became the Vice-Chief of Army Staff before becoming the fourth officer from the Gorkha Brigade to become the COAS.
 
He was instrumental in reducing the militancy in the Northeast, with one of the highlights of his career being the 2015 cross-border operation into Myanmar in which the Indian Army successfully responded to an ambush by NSCN-K militants. The mission was conducted from the operation command of Dimapur-based III Corps under Rawat's supervision.
 
He was also part of the planning for the 2016 surgical strikes, in which the Indian Army went across the Line of Control into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Rawat, it was reported, was monitoring the developments from South Block in New Delhi.
 
During his service, General Rawat had been decorated with the Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Uttam Yudh Seva Medal, Ati Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal, Yudh Seva Medal, and Sena Medal.

<b>The Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat was serving in the 4th battalion, 4th Garhwal Rifles on 17 November 1962 during the Battle of Nuranang, in the North-East Frontier Agency (now Arunachal Pradesh). On that day, the 4th Garhwal Rifles had beaten back two People's Liberation Army charges on their position. During a third intrusion, a Chinese medium machine gun (MMG) had come close to the Indian defenses and was firing accurately at their positions. Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat, along with Lance Naik Trilok Singh Negi and Rifleman Gopal Singh Gusain volunteered to subdue the MMG.[2][3][4][5]

Rawat and Gusain, aided by covering fire from Negi closed within a grenade-throwing distance of the machine gun position and neutralized the Chinese detachment of five sentries, seizing the MMG in the process. However, while returning, Gusain and Negi lost their lives and Rawat was seriously injured, although he managed to return with the captured weapon. The battle resulted in 300 Chinese casualties, whereas the 4th Garhwal Rifles lost two men and had eight wounded.[6]

Rawat's company eventually decided to withdraw, but Rawat remained and kept up the fight with the help of two local girls named Sela and Noora. Later, Sela was killed and Noora captured. Rushing from position to position, Rawat held off the enemy for 72 hours until the Chinese captured a local supplier, who told them that they were facing only one fighter. The Chinese then stormed Rawat's position, but the exact details of his death are unclear. Some accounts claim that Rawat shot himself with his last round of ammunition; others state that he was taken prisoner and executed by the Chinese. The Chinese commander returned Rawat's severed head and a brass bust of him to India after the war was over.[7]

The bravery shown by Jaswant Rawat was honored by building a memorial at the post where he fended off the People's Liberation Army

. The post which he held was named "Jaswant Garh".[8][9] Another honor bestowed upon him is that he continues to serve even after death; he has been awarded promotions as if he is still serving.[10]

4th Garhwal Rifles was later awarded the Battle Honour Nuranang, the only battle honor awarded to an army unit during the war.</b>
